Image 1: The user clicked the Increase Counter button until the counter showed 27.  The "simple for loop" and "repetition with condition" behaved as described.
Image 2: Using a counter value of 27, the Arrays button was used to print to the console an array of all multiples of 5 until that number, in reverse order.  The "Objects and Form Fields" exercises resulted in data being loaded or typed into the form, and then printed as an object to the console.  Lastly, the "Changing Styles" buttons behaved as described.
